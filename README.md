# Advanced Programming in R  
### University of Augsburg ‚Äî Centre for Climate Resilience  

This repository contains all teaching materials, R scripts, and example applications used in the **Advanced Programming in R** course taught by **Dr. C√©sar Iv√°n √Ålvarez Mendoza** at the **University of Augsburg**.  

The course introduces students to advanced techniques in R for data analysis, visualization, spatial data processing, and interactive application development using *Shiny* and *Leaflet*.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply R programming for scientific data analysis and visualization.  
- Import and process spatial and environmental data (shapefiles, rasters, Excel, CSV).  
- Build and customize static and interactive charts using **ggplot2** and **plotly**.  
- Create and deploy **interactive web maps** using **Leaflet** and **Shiny**.  
- Integrate open data sources (e.g., DWD, EEA, ERA5-Land) into R workflows.  
- Export and share analytical outputs for research and publications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use the Code

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the R scripts in **RStudio**.  
3. Run each script section by section to understand the workflow.  
4. Modify file paths (`C:/data/...`) to match your own directory structure.  
5. Install required packages when prompted (e.g., `ggplot2`, `leaflet`, `readxl`, `dplyr`, `shiny`).

## üöÄ Deployment to ShinyApps.io

If you want to share your R Shiny applications online, follow these steps:

1. Install and load the **rsconnect** package:
   ```r
   install.packages("rsconnect")
   library(rsconnect)
